Worked with creating the Mako engine allowing users to create own views in Spotify Ultra. This is an 
simple implementation of the Mako engine but with javascript syntax for C# application. Apart from the
graphical view subsystem.

Decided to use an own drawn board like in Spotify, the advantadge of this is that we get better access to the elements 
and have full control over it. Among disadvantadges is stability and trouble with the drawing cache. This should however
be an separate project apart from Spotify ultra so we can re use it for own sake.

Skip an repurchase of the stolen phone; we assign the easter 
time to this work and also refract the economy. Just also though
something we got in the bad thing; otherwise there would be more
android work than this... And we need to make some out of this...

 * Fixed view system like Spotify

Fixed vertical scrollbars
10:42 2011-04-22
* Fixed links in rows and possible to seek rows by up/down buttons.

16:14 2011-04-22

 * Added local file feature
 * Use MediaChrome as plugin base to be able to extend the app in the future
 * Added local album view in artist view.
14:59 2011-04-25
 * Fixed issues with artist view.
 * Increased performance by smart drawing
 * Fixing coverart for Spotify albums
11:15 2011-04-26
 * UI takes 99% of CPU, localaizxed 20% of problem to the cover view, disabled it to 
see what I can do with it
13:05 2011-04-26
 * Reduced CPU % usage by -60% by locking image download threads.
10:02 2011-05-06
 * Rewrited the view subsystem and drawing so the object below the cursor is decided at drawing time, it 
saves resources since it won't raise recheck on every time the cursor moves.
 * Added Artist, Album class subsystem to MediaChrome and fixed so view subsystem now can handle several plugins
by associating the first setence befoer : as pointer to IPlayEngine and associate the view content to this instead
of ws.spotify.com as it ease the mediachrome target.
