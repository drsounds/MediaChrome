I graduate from Portalens Gymnasium on June 15th, 2011. Throughout my education at Portalens Gymnasium, I have been involved in a bunch of personal and eductional software projects, mostly at the web development.
 During 2009, I was the one to set up an call marketing php based application to enable a Lidköping-based company, 'Sweden Conference Group' to assign telemarketing project to teams and track call marketing projects.
 

Introduction:
 I'm an passionated emerging software developer, and loves to work with software project. I tend to have an delighted love to work with computer projects from the early morning to late evenings, with some sleep and eat breaks. I'm  philosophing about solution of programming problems when I'm taking breaks and often come up with avant-garde ideas and solutions that brings big impressions. I'm thinking in computer and logic problems nearly 24/7 and hope I can do something good for you.
